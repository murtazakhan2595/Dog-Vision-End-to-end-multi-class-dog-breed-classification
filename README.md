# Dog Breed Identification using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dog Breed Identification project, where we use deep learning techniques to identify the breed of a dog given an image of a dog. This project is based on the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification competition dataset, which consists of more than 10,000 images of 120 different breeds of dogs.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow 2.0
- TensorFlow Hub
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Problem Statement

Given an image of a dog, the objective is to classify the breed of the dog from one of the 120 different classes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle's Dog Breed Identification competition. It contains over 10,000 images of dogs, with labels indicating their corresponding breeds.

## Data Preprocessing

- Images are turned into numerical representations (tensors).
- Images are resized to a consistent size (224x224 pixels).
- Data is split into training and validation sets.

## Model Architecture

We use transfer learning by leveraging a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub, specifically MobileNetV2. We add a dense output layer with 120 units (one for each breed) and softmax activation for classification.

## Training

The model is trained on the training data using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Training is monitored using accuracy as a metric. Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting.

## Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated on the validation set, and predictions are made. These predictions are visualized using various techniques, including plotting the top prediction and prediction confidence for sample images.

## Model Performance

The model's performance is assessed using accuracy on the validation set. The model's generalization ability is checked by predicting labels for custom dog images not seen during training.

## Making Predictions

Finally, the trained model is used to make predictions on the test dataset, and the results are saved in a CSV file for submission to the Kaggle competition.

## Conclusion

Dog breed identification is a challenging task that can be effectively solved using deep learning techniques. Transfer learning, specifically with models like MobileNetV2, simplifies the process of building accurate models with limited data. The model's performance and predictions can be further improved by fine-tuning hyperparameters, exploring different architectures, and utilizing advanced techniques.
